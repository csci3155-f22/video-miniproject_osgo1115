# Implementing Promise uising higher order functions

## Description

Reviewing Higher order functions by implementing the Promise class in `Typescript`. I also worked on a side priject `sudokusolver`, which utilies the  `MyPromise` class that I implemented.




## Building and Testing Instructions

To start the sudokusolver in dev mode, enter the `sudokusolver` directory and run `npm install`, which will install the dependencies.
After that, run `npm start`, which will start the local development server at http://localhost:3000.

### Testing `MyPromise` class
go to the root directory and run `npm install`, which will install `jest` testing library. After that, run `npm test`.
